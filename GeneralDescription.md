# Hybrid Monophonic Synthesizer Project

## Features

### Software part

* 2 VCOs generated by STM32 DACs and controlled via potentiometers
  * 1 Tuning pot (+- 12 semitons)
	* 1 Waveform selector (sin, square (PWM), saw, triangle, off)
	* The mixing and amplitude part of the 2 VCOs is done by Hardware
*1 LFO generated by PWM
	* 1 pot Speed
	* 1 waveform selector switch
* 1 ADSR Envelope Generator generated by PWM
	* 4 pot : attack, decay, sustain, release
